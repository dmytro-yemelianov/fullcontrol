# Toolpath Compiler — architecture

The system is a **multi-level IR with a Rust engine and thin multi-language front-ends**. Data flows
through dialects that lower into each other; passes transform within and between levels; the engine is
one Rust codebase compiling to native and wasm.

## 1. TPIR — the multi-level IR

Not one flat structure: **dialects**, each a typed node set, with explicit lowering between them
(the MLIR idea — progressive lowering, each level verifiable).

- **L0 — design / feature dialect.** High-level intent: `Vessel`, `InfillRegion`, `Feature@pose`,
  `Repeat`, `Group`. Carries parameters + provenance. This is what an authoring SDK emits.
- **L1 — path dialect.** Parametric geometry with typed channels: `Line`, `Arc`, `Spline`, `Clothoid`,
  `Dwell`, `ToolChange`. Per-point/per-segment channels (§3). Still resolution-independent (a curve, not
  points).
- **L2 — motion dialect.** Resolved, machine-agnostic moves with absolute state — the equivalent of the
  fork's `Toolpath`/`Segment`, but **toolframe-general** and columnar. This is where simulate / verify /
  optimise operate. Most reuse from the fork lives here.
- **L3 — target dialect.** Machine-specific ops (g-code words for a flavor; STEP-NC working-steps; GRBL;
  robot motion). `emit` serialises L3 to text/bytes.

Each dialect has a **verifier** (well-formedness + declared invariants). Lowering L(n)→L(n+1) is a pass
that must preserve the level's invariants.

## 2. The toolframe (not XYZ)

Every motion carries a **toolframe**: `position: Point3<Length>` + `orientation: Rotation` (unit
quaternion; or an axis tuple for machine-native B/C). Planar 3-axis FFF is the **constraint**
`orientation == identity ∧ tool ∥ +Z`, not a special case. Consequences:
- **Non-planar** (z varies within a move) and **5-axis / robotic** (tilting toolframe) are *native*, not
  `lab/`-experimental.
- L3 lowering projects the toolframe to the machine's kinematics (3-axis: drop orientation; 5-axis:
  inverse-kinematics to B/C; robot: to joints).

## 3. Typed quantities & channels

**Units are types, not convention.** `Length` (mm), `Speed` (mm/s internally; emit converts to mm/min),
`Volume` (mm³), `Flow` (mm³/s), `Temperature` (°C), `Angle` (rad). Mixed-unit arithmetic is a *compile
error* in the Rust core and a typed wrapper in the SDKs. (Contrast: FC carried units as comments and a v2
header bolted on after the fact.)

**Channels** are the typed, *extensible* per-point/per-segment state a move carries, beyond geometry:
`extrusion` (deposited volume / filament), `speed`, `width`, `height`, `temperature`, `fan`, `flow`,
`tool`, `color`. Channels are a registry (new processes add channels without changing the core), each
with a type and a default-propagation rule. Variable-everything (width, flow, temp along a path) is the
*normal case*, not special-cased as FC's per-segment `ExtrusionGeometry` hacks were.

## 4. Pure functional core & the pass framework

**Authoring is `design(params) → L0 IR`, a pure function.** The deposition math + state propagation
(FC's running point, extruder e-ratio, primer injection) becomes an explicit **lowering pass**
(`resolve: L1 → L2`), *not* entangled with authoring. Benefits: deterministic, content-addressable
(hash the IR), cacheable, diffable, trivially parallel. No mutable global authoring state; no
`Date.now()`/`random` in the core.

**Passes** are the unit of transformation. Each declares: input dialect, output dialect, **preconditions**,
**invariants preserved**, and ordering constraints. Categories:
- *Lowering* (L0→L1→L2→L3): `expand_features`, `resolve` (deposition/state), `to_target`.
- *Optimisation* (within L2, semantics-preserving unless intended): `merge_collinear`, `arc_fit`,
  `simplify` (RDP), `travel_reorder` (TSP), `adaptive_speed`, `coasting`, `z_hop`, `retract_on_travel`.
  (Ported from the fork's `ir/passes.py` + the engine's `gcode_engine/passes/`.)
- *Analysis* (no transform): `simulate`, `verify`, `reverse`.
A pass manager runs a declared pipeline; every pass is independently testable against its invariants.

## 5. Storage: columnar & streaming

L2 is stored **column-major** (struct-of-arrays, Arrow-compatible): start/end as N×3, plus
travel/speed/length/volume/filament/width/height/toolframe columns. This is the zero-copy ABI between
the engine and any consumer, and is **streamable** so a million-segment print never materialises as
objects. Two serialisations of the same IR:
- **JSON** — human-readable interchange (versioned, with units/provenance/invariants header).
- **Binary** — the compact columnar form (magic + typed column blocks + a JSON metadata tail), the
  default wire format between native/wasm/SDKs and the on-disk archive. (The fork's `ir/binary.py` is the
  prototype.)

## 6. Provenance & invariants (first-class)

- **Provenance:** every node records what produced it (design name + params, or source line for parsed
  machine code), making `reverse_engineer`/`identify` *exact* and enabling diff/blame.
- **Invariants / contracts:** designs *declare* contracts (`monotonic_layer_z`, `within_build_volume`,
  `no_cold_extrusion`, `bounded_flow`, `non_self_intersecting`, `bounded_overhang`, …); the verifier
  enforces them — checking is part of the *type/contract layer*, not a backend you remember to call.
  (The fork's `check_invariants` + `verify_gcode` rules are the seed.)

## 7. The engine API (Rust core, one surface)

```
lower(ir, pipeline)        -> ir           # run a lowering/optimisation pipeline
simulate(ir)               -> Metrics       # time, distances, material, peak flow, …
verify(ir, contracts)      -> Report        # invariants + rule checks, with locations
optimise(ir, passes)       -> (ir, Report)  # opt passes + before/after metrics
emit(ir@L3, target)        -> bytes/text    # serialise to machine code
parse(bytes, dialect)      -> ir@L2         # machine code → IR (inverse of emit)
reverse(ir|toolpath)       -> design        # toolpath → parametric design/params
```

One codebase, two builds: **native** (CLI, server, PyO3) and **wasm** (browser, TS). The fork already
proved a Rust kernel serving both PyO3 and wasm (`rust_kernel/` with feature-gated `python`/`wasm`
bindings) — that is the literal foundation.

## 8. Authoring SDKs (thin, logic-free)

Each SDK is a pleasant builder DSL that **emits L0/L1 TPIR and contains no business logic** — the engine
lowers. So SDKs stay tiny and never drift (they all target the TPIR spec + a conformance suite):
- **Python** — FC-flavored ergonomics for the existing community (migration path); now just a front-end.
- **TypeScript** — browser/Node native (the fork's `ts/` binding is the prototype: it already emits IR
  that the engine consumes, byte-matching Python to 1e-9).
- **Rust** — for embedding / high-performance generators.
Bindings call the engine via PyO3 (Python), wasm-bindgen (TS/browser), or directly (Rust).

## 9. Targets & interop (back-end dialects)

L3 lowering is target-specific and pluggable:
- **FFF g-code** — flavor vocabulary (Marlin/Klipper/Duet); ports the fork's `gcode/flavor.py` +
  `rust_kernel/src/gcode.rs` (byte-identical Marlin is the first parity gate).
- **CNC** — RS-274; optionally **STEP-NC (ISO 14649)** intent export (carry features/working-steps).
- **Laser** — GRBL.
- **Robot** — per-vendor motion (KRL/RAPID) from the toolframe + IK.
- **Interchange** — import/export **3MF Toolpath** (the strategic standard target), import **mesh**
  (STL/3MF) for hybrid design. (The fork's `ir/threemf.py` is the prototype.)

## 10. What is reused from the fork (the ~60–70%)

| New system component | Bootstrap from the fork |
|---|---|
| L2 motion dialect + columnar | `fullcontrol/ir/{toolpath,columnar}.py`, `rust_kernel/src/walk.rs` |
| simulate | `rust_kernel/src/metrics.rs`, `simulate/run.py` |
| emit (FFF g-code) | `rust_kernel/src/gcode.rs`, `gcode/{flavor,dialect}.py` |
| parse (g-code → IR) | `rust_kernel/src/parser.rs`, `gcode_engine/parser.py` |
| optimisation passes | `ir/passes.py`, `gcode_engine/passes/` |
| verify / invariants | `validate/`, `gcode_engine/rules/`, `ir/invariants.py` |
| reverse-engineer | `examples/reverse_engineer.py` |
| serialisation (JSON+binary) | `ir/serialize.py`, `ir/binary.py` |
| TS front-end | `ts/` |
| device profiles (~695) | `fullcontrol/devices/` |
| conformance fixtures | the ~906 tests + golden g-code + the 27-design gallery |
| web/wasm runtime + demo | `web/`, `rust_kernel` wasm bindings |

The architecture is therefore not a blank page — it is a **re-layering and generalisation** of pieces
that already exist and are tested, with the FC surface removed.
